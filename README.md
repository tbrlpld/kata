Kata
====

This is a collection of small programming projects I solved to practice my programming skills. 
I first learned about the Kata concept in the book [Clean Coder](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073) by [Robert Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin). 
Topics for coding kata can be found in this [list](http://codingdojo.org/kata/).
